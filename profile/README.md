# VR First responder at MCI simulation 
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our thesis work on VR First Responder Accident Scene Simulation! This project aims to modernize training methods for first responders by using Virtual Reality (VR) technology to create an immersive accident scene simulation.

### Overview
In emergency situations, quick and effective responses from first responders can save lives. However, traditional training methods often lack realistic scenarios for practice. Our project addresses this by developing a VR simulation platform tailored for first responder training.

### Key Features
**Immersive VR Experience**: Experience an accident scene in a virtual environment.
**Real-time Interaction**: Interact with patients in real-time within the VR simulation.
**Performance Evaluation**: Provide feedback and performance evaluation metrics to enhance learning outcomes.

### Disclaimer: 
**This project is developed as part of a thesis work and should not be used in real-life emergency situations. Always rely on certified training and procedures for actual first responder duties.**
